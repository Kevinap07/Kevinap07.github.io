    <h2>Problem statement: Nutrition</h2>
    <p>
      A program that will be able to track the calories and be able to know what nutrition facts by just writing down the name of the food.

      When ordering stuff on things like doordash, uber eats, etc. you will be able to have the nutrition information in a table by just running it.

      If the nutrition information is not available about the food from a certain restaurant or from your home you will be able to type it in manually 
      into the program or the program will have an option that will try and guess the nutrition information like: sugar, carbs, calories, etc.
